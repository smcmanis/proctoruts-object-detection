Login and Logout Function (both user and invigilator)
---------
Login - minor issues
- Pressing enter doesn’t sign in (need to click button with mouse)
- After clicking the login button, there is a 2-3 second delay before it redirects to dashboard. During the delay it is unclear whether the website is responding.
Logout - No issues
    
Invigilator screens
---------
- Clicking “Start Exam” shows a “Read Before Taking Exam” dialog. It seems like this is meant for the student side, not invigilator side.
- Clicking the notifications menu button doesn’t do anything
- High response latency b/w clicking other menu buttons and seeing response (maybe only for the first time visiting a page.)

    - starting exam successfully shows current exam and enter exam room
    - Entering exam room is slow to respond
